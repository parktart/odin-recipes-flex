Odin Recipes Project (flex)

This is a copy of my Recipes Project in TOP's curriculum! The first iteration used only html and some basic CSS. I want to preserve that version to look back on, and style this new version starting with a blank `style.css` file. I'm starting with only the raw html because I just learned flexbox! Some knowledge I hope to use..

* proper use of `flex: auto, initial, none, or 1`
* `justify` and `align` properties
* using the same HTML for both Desktop and Mobile
* proper shrinking for a smooth Mobile experience

Please enjoy!
